# py-radio-autoencoder
Python implementation of autoencoder based channel coding over an AWGN link.

# Description
Simulates a radio link over AWGN channel for Uncoded, Hamming coded and Neural network autoencoded radio links. Reproduces the results obtained in "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" by Timothy J. O'Shea and Jakob Hoydis [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00832].

Relies on Tensorflow and Py-ITPP (https://github.com/vidits-kth/py-itpp).
